        <div class="subheading mb-5">English MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently I am attending the University of California, Riverside, as an English major. My graduating year is 2024. I plan on majoring in English and minoring in Education to become an English teacher for high school students. Some of my personal experience with the English subject from high school consists of being enrolled in an honors english course for freshmen year, A.P. (Advanced Placement) during sophomore year, and two years of I.B. (International Baccalaureate) for both my junior and senior year. All of these rigorous classes called for critical analysis on the different prose of writing(s) that were introduced throughout the courses. Which is why, I wish to teach advanced course classes, such as Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and honors courses. However, I am also interested in being able to teach sheltered classes for non-speaking English students, to further their knowledge of the English language as a subject. I have first hand experience of what it takes to be enrolled in the different advanced programs and how it is effective in learning more about the English subject. After completing my major, I plan on attending a different college to get my teaching license and master's degree to further my education. <br><br>

        As of 2020 I am employed as a Tutor for a high school, where I help students with their multiple subjects in school, ranging from ninth grade to twelfth grade. The subjects range from English, to math, foreign language (French and Spanish), and performing arts. This job opportunity is something that I am using as a reference and background experience of assisting students for the future in becoming a teacher. Through this experience I have learned that I am thoroughly enjoying the opportunity of being able to assist students in their homework, during a pandemic. <br><br>

        Now, during college, as a first year English Major I have taken 4 english courses that have all focused on various topics. The first courses are English 001 A, and B, and English 020 B, and C. English 001 A and B have helped me with strengthening the various types of essay formats and writing that are presented in advance English course classes that are to come in the future for my advanced courses. English 020 B and C are prerequisites that I need to take before moving onto an advanced course for my major. These courses help me with analyzing different types of writing during different periods, as well as different types of media, such as films, and music. In the future, for my second year of college, I plan on taking my last round of prerequisites, being English 001 C and English 020A. By taking these courses I will then be able to move on and take the continuing courses that are mandatory for the betterment of my writing and critical thinking. Through the courses that I will be taking at UCR, I will be able to attain my degree and become an English teacher for high school students, and eventually students in Community College.
